# Rationale template

The prose that ships alongside the type sketch. One page. Sentence-case
headings, no boilerplate. Replace the italic notes with actual content.

## Problem

*One paragraph. What we are trying to do, and what about the existing system
or constraints makes the shape non-obvious. If
[Phase A](../SKILL.md#phase-a-ground-the-problem) surfaced constraints the
design must honor, name them here so the reader sees the same constraints you
saw. Examples are existing types to interoperate with, callers we cannot
break, and invariants that cross our boundary.*

## Usage (caller's view)

*Write this first, before the type sketch. Show the README or quickstart the
consumer reads, plus two or three realistic call sites in their own code. Show
what they import, what they call, and what comes back. The type sketch in
[Shape](#shape) is derived from this. The two must agree. When they diverge,
reconcile the sketch to the usage, not the reverse. The caller's experience is
the spec. The types serve it.*

## Shape

*The recommended architecture. Data structures first. Then how data flows
through the signatures. Name the load-bearing decisions. State which
invariants are encoded in types, where validation lives, and what the system
deliberately does not do. Judge interface depth explicitly. State what
complexity the public surface hides, what stays exposed to callers, and why
the interface is no larger than needed. Cite the principle behind each
decision, such as "per boundary-discipline". Do not restate it.*

## Synthesis decision

*Filled in by the lead in [Phase B](../SKILL.md#phase-b-sketch). Records which
candidate became the base and why, what was adapted from each of the others,
and what was rejected and why.*

## Tradeoffs accepted

*One bullet per tradeoff the chosen shape makes, in the form "we accept X in
exchange for Y". Name anything a future reader might mistake for an
oversight, including things that look like premature optimization or
premature simplification.*

## Alternatives considered

*Required. Name at least one concrete alternative shape, with one line on why
it lost. Judge each alternative on interface depth, not implementation
simplicity alone. Name the complexity it exposes to callers and the
complexity it hides. Two or three alternatives belong here when the design
space had real contenders. One is fine when the constraints forced the answer,
with the conclusion phrased as "this was the only viable shape because...".
Do not list flavors of the same shape. This section covers design alternatives
the chosen shape considered and rejected, not other runner candidates.*

## Open questions and risks

*Things you noticed during the sketch that the human needs to weigh in on, and
risks worth flagging before implementation starts. Phrase them as questions,
not assertions, so the human's answer is the resolution rather than a
comment.*

## Next implementation step

*The first thing to build against the sketch, in one sentence. What you would
start writing right after synthesis, or after sign-off when a checkpoint was
requested.*
