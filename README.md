## Installation

### Claude Code (plugin)

Register this repo as a marketplace and install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kpeez/agent-toolbox
/plugin install knack@agent-toolbox
/plugin install lab@agent-toolbox
```

> `lab` is optional — install it on research machines where you use `autoresearch` and `data-viz`.

### Codex CLI (plugin)

Register this repo as a marketplace and install:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add kpeez/agent-toolbox
codex plugin add knack@agent-toolbox
codex plugin add lab@agent-toolbox
```

> The Codex plugin delivers skills only. Codex plugins do not deliver agents, so
> the Codex `.toml` subagents are installed by the manual script below.

### Manual install (Codex agents, Antigravity, Copilot, and helper scripts)

Claude Code installs entirely from its plugin. Codex CLI installs skills from its
plugin but needs the manual script for its subagents. Use the manual script for
Codex agents and for providers that do not have a complete plugin install path
here. Skill scripts need no install — skills run them in place with `uv run`.

```bash
./scripts/setup-agent.sh
```

This installs to:

| Target          | Installed by manual script                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Codex agents    | `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`                               |
| Antigravity CLI | `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md` + skills symlinked from the repo |
| Copilot CLI     | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`                   |
| Statusline      | `~/.agents/bin/cc-statusline`                          |

Re-run after updating agent-toolbox.

### Versioning

Each plugin's version lives in exactly two files, kept identical: its
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. The marketplace
files (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`)
carry no versions or metadata — they only point at the plugin directories.
Bump both manifests at once:

```bash
scripts/bump-plugin-version.sh knack 1.0.2
```

## Workflow

The spine is **grill → spec → issues → implement → review → ship**. Work enters at
one of three points: `/grill-me` for a new feature whose design isn't settled,
`/diagnose` for a known bug, or `/improve-codebase-architecture` when you're
hunting for refactors. For non-trivial work these converge on `/write-spec`; a
small fix can skip straight to implement.

Once the spec is settled, `/to-issues` publishes it (parent issue + sub-issues)
and **the tracker takes over** — each issue is then picked up independently, in a
fresh chat or a subagent, and runs its own implement → review → ship loop.
Implementation uses two disciplines: `/tdd` (one failing test → minimal code) and
`/blueprint` (verify a planned implementation against the real repo, then promote
the slice). `/blueprint` also stands alone as a design spike before you commit to
an approach. Durable decisions get recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/` along the way.

| Phase                                 | When / what happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/grill-me`                           | **Entry: new feature, design unsettled.** Stress-test the plan against the code, sharpen terminology (into `CONTEXT.md`), record durable decisions as ADRs in `docs/adr/`.                                                                                   |
| `/diagnose`                           | **Entry: known bug.** Build a fast deterministic feedback loop, reproduce, rank hypotheses, instrument, fix, regression-test. Small fixes go straight to implement; complex ones feed a spec.                                                                |
| `/improve-codebase-architecture`      | **Entry: hunting refactors.** Find shallow modules and propose deepening refactors (deletion test, deep modules), informed by `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`.                                                                                                  |
| `/write-spec`                         | Capture the settled plan — `SPEC.md` (human goal/scope header + agent design body) plus runnable examples. In plan mode, dump the approved plan straight in. Establishes intent.                                                                             |
| `/to-issues`                          | Publish the spec as a parent issue + sub-issues (vertical slices); the tracker becomes the task and status ledger. Skip it only for a single-slice spec you implement in one sitting.                                                                        |
| **implement (`/tdd` + `/blueprint`)** | Per issue, in a fresh chat or subagent: vertical slices, one test → one implementation (never horizontal batches). Blueprint examples import the real repo to prove behavior, then graft in. No mock-slop. `/blueprint` also stands alone as a design spike. |
| `/adversarial-review`                 | Clean-context hostile pass in a fresh reviewer. Challenges the approach/design, then flags bloat, smells, and newly obsolete code. Review-only — returns findings; `/ship` applies them.                                                                     |
| `/pr`                                 | Group the diff into atomic commits, push, open a draft PR if missing, link it to the tracker issue(s).                                                                                                                                                       |

Not every session hits every phase. The dashed skills are alternate entry points
or on-demand spikes. `/adversarial-review` is most useful before `/pr`; use
`/ship` to run it and `/pr` back-to-back. To resume across a session boundary, drop
a progress comment on the active tracker issue and pick it up from there.

## Durable decision memory

Two committed files hold knowledge that must outlive a single feature and survive
a fresh clone — distinct from the private, ephemeral `specs/` tree:

- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records. Created lazily by `/grill-me`,
  `/blueprint`, or `/improve-codebase-architecture` when a decision is hard to
  reverse, surprising without context, and the result of a real trade-off. They
  stop the agent from re-litigating settled choices.
- **`CONTEXT.md`** _(optional, repo root)_ — a domain glossary, nothing else.
  Pins down overloaded terminology (especially useful for ML/research repos). Read
  by `grill-me`, `diagnose`, and `improve-codebase-architecture`.

The issue tracker is selected at runtime by `/to-issues` — an optional
`Issue tracker: <name>` line in the repo's `AGENTS.md` wins; otherwise Linear
when its MCP tools are available, GitHub when the repo has a GitHub remote and
`gh` works, local markdown under `specs/<feature>/issues/` as the fallback.
Conventions for each live in the `to-issues` skill's `references/`; there is no
per-repo config file.

## GitHub Workflow

Specs are work programs, not PR containers. A single spec can produce multiple
atomic PRs.

- Prefer atomic PRs that can be reviewed independently.
- Use small, logical commits with imperative, conventional-style subjects.
- Generate PR titles and bodies directly from `SPEC.md`, the linked tracker
  issues, and the actual diff.
- Do not create `commits.md` or `draft-pr.md` review artifacts.
- Use squash merge by default unless the user explicitly asks for another merge
  method.
- After a PR merges, comment the PR number, merge or squash commit SHA, and a
  short note about what shipped on the relevant tracker issue, and move it to
  Done. Status lives on the tracker, not in a local file.

## Specs Setup

Specs are private working context and should never be committed. Store the real
files outside the repo (for example `~/Documents/specs/<repo>/`, cloud-synced
and per-repo), add `specs` to `.gitignore`, and symlink `./specs` back in:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/specs/<repo>
ln -s ~/Documents/specs/<repo> ./specs
echo specs >> .gitignore
```

If you use a worktree-based setup, you should set up the following post-checkout git hook to automatically symlink the specs directory:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# post-checkout: $1=prev HEAD, $2=new HEAD, $3=1 if branch checkout

# only act on branch checkouts (not file restores)
[ "$3" = "1" ] || exit 0

# only act when we're inside a linked worktree, not the main repo
git_dir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
[[ "$git_dir" == *"/worktrees/"* ]] || exit 0

ln -sfn ~/Documents/specs/<repo> "$(pwd)/specs"
```

## Feature Specs

A spec is **`SPEC.md` plus `examples/`** — nothing more (created by `/write-spec new`):

```text
specs/
├── AGENTS.md           # How agents navigate specs; not a manual index
└── <feature>/
    ├── SPEC.md         # Human goal/scope header + agent-expanded design body
    └── examples/       # Runnable verification scripts (REQUIRED)
```

`SPEC.md` has two ownership zones split by a `---` divider. The **goal/scope
header** is the user-reviewed contract: goal, scope, non-goals, success criteria,
validation, and whether implementation is review-gated or autonomous. The
**design body** is agent-expanded after repo inspection: approach, behavior,
decision log, risks, and verification mapping. Durable decisions (architecture,
provider policy, storage model, framework choice) go in committed `docs/adr/`,
not the spec.

The spec is a **local, transient design draft** — it forces design thinking and
gives a review gate, then `/to-issues` hands the work to the tracker. There is no
local `STATUS.md`: the **issue tracker is the task and status ledger**, because
it's the one ledger every agent and your phone can read with no local convention.

- `/to-issues` publishes the spec's goal/scope as a **parent issue** plus
  **sub-issues** (the vertical slices) — the portable default on Linear and
  GitHub; escalate to a Linear **project** only for large, multi-milestone specs.
- Status is the issue state, blockers are the blocked-by links, and progress is
  the container rollup (e.g. 3/7 done) — reviewable remotely, maintained for free.
- **Resume across agents or context limits:** read the tracker container, grab the
  next unblocked issue, and before you run out of context drop a short progress
  comment on the active issue (done / next / the one gotcha). That comment is the
  handoff, living where the next agent already looks.

The examples are the verification record — rerun them to confirm behavior. Don't
keep a separate run log.
